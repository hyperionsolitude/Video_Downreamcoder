# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-01-27

### üöÄ Performance & Optimization
- **Enhanced Metal GPU Support**: Optimized VideoToolbox configuration for maximum Apple Silicon utilization
- **Improved Type Hints**: Added comprehensive type annotations for better code maintainability
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and fallback mechanisms
- **Code Quality**: Improved imports organization and code structure

### üîß macOS Improvements
- **Security Integration**: Automatic quarantine attribute removal for generated video files
- **Metal Presets**: Added dedicated h264_metal and h265_metal presets for maximum GPU usage
- **Hardware Optimization**: Enhanced VideoToolbox parameters (-prio_speed, -spatial_aq, -power_efficient)

### üìö Documentation & Setup
- **Enhanced README**: Added badges, better structure, and comprehensive feature descriptions
- **Improved Setup Scripts**: Better error handling, colored output, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Requirements Optimization**: Pinned package versions for better stability
- **Git Integration**: Added comprehensive .gitignore for better repository management

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- **Code Organization**: Improved function signatures and documentation
- **Platform Detection**: Enhanced cross-platform compatibility detection
- **Setup Scripts**: Better logging and error reporting in installation scripts

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-19

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Anime OP/ED Auto-Trim**: Detects intro/outro via audio similarity (MFCC) across episodes
- **Per-Episode Alignment**: Finds the best OP/ED offsets per file when timing shifts
- **Deleted Parts Review**: Exports removed segments and builds a `deleted.mp4` concat for verification
- **Preview Detected Ranges**: UI shows per-file OP/ED ranges with confidence before encoding

### üîß Improvements
- **Copy Preset**: Truly copies when possible (single-file copy and concat with `-c copy`), fallback to minimal re-encode only if needed
- **One-Click Cleanup**: Option to keep only the final merged output and `deleted.mp4`, removing all residuals
- **Auto-Detect Fallback**: If AI trim is enabled without manual/detected ranges, detection runs automatically at encode time

### üêõ Fixes
- Ensured trimming applies even with "copy" preset by handling concat compatibility
- Stabilized temp directory cleanup and file list handling

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-18

### üéâ Major Release - Merged Application
