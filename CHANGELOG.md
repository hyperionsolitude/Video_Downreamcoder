# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-19

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Anime OP/ED Auto-Trim**: Detects intro/outro via audio similarity (MFCC) across episodes
- **Per-Episode Alignment**: Finds the best OP/ED offsets per file when timing shifts
- **Deleted Parts Review**: Exports removed segments and builds a `deleted.mp4` concat for verification
- **Preview Detected Ranges**: UI shows per-file OP/ED ranges with confidence before encoding

### üîß Improvements
- **Copy Preset**: Truly copies when possible (single-file copy and concat with `-c copy`), fallback to minimal re-encode only if needed
- **One-Click Cleanup**: Option to keep only the final merged output and `deleted.mp4`, removing all residuals
- **Auto-Detect Fallback**: If AI trim is enabled without manual/detected ranges, detection runs automatically at encode time

### üêõ Fixes
- Ensured trimming applies even with "copy" preset by handling concat compatibility
- Stabilized temp directory cleanup and file list handling
